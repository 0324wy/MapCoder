# Algorithm: Kadane's Algorithm
Kadane's algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.

# Tutorial:
## Step 1: Initialize variables
Initialize two variables, `max_sum` and `current_sum`, to store the maximum sum and the current sum, respectively.

## Step 2: Iterate over the array
Iterate over the array, and for each element, update the `current_sum` by adding the current element. If the `current_sum` is less than the current element, reset `current_sum` to the current element.

## Step 3: Update the maximum sum
Update the `max_sum` if the `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

## Step 4: Return the maximum sum
Return the `max_sum` as the maximum sum of a subarray.

## Step 5: Time complexity
The time complexity of Kadane's algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Step 6: Space complexity
The space complexity of Kadane's algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the `max_sum` and `current_sum`.

## Step 7: Example use case
Kadane's algorithm can be used to find the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array of numbers.

## Step 8: Advantages
Kadane's algorithm has a linear time complexity, making it efficient for large arrays. It also has a low space complexity, making it suitable for memory-constrained systems.

## Step 9: Disadvantages
Kadane's algorithm has a high constant factor, making it slower than other algorithms for small arrays. It also assumes that the input array is not empty.

## Step 10: Variations
There are several variations of Kadane's algorithm, including a modified version that uses a stack to store the maximum sum of subarrays.

## Step 11: Applications
Kadane's algorithm has several applications, including finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array of numbers, finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array of integers, and finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array of floating-point numbers.

## Step 12: Conclusion
Kadane's algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It has a low space complexity and is efficient for large arrays. However, it has a high constant factor and assumes that the input array is not empty.
