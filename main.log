________________________
Input for knowledge base and exemplars: 
Given a problem, provide relevant problems then identify the algorithm behind it and also explain the tutorial of the algorithm.
# Problem:


def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])


def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """


# Exemplars:
Recall three (03) relevant and distinct problems (different from problem mentioned above). For each problem,
1. describe it
2. generate Python3 code step by step to solve that problem
3. finally generate a planning to solve that problem

# Algorithm:

----------------
Important:
Your response must follow the following xml format-

<root>
<problem>
# Recall three (03) relevant and distinct problems (different from problem mentioned above). Write each problem in the following format.
<description>
# Describe the problem.
</description>
<code>
# Let's think step by step to solve this problem in Python3 programming language.
</code>
<planning>
# Planning to solve this problem.
</planning>
</problem>

# similarly add more problems here...

<algorithm>
# Identify the algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
# Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving this types of problem. Do not generate code.
</algorithm>
